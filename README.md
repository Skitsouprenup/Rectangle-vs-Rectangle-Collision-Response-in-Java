# Rectangle-vs-Rectangle-Collision-Response-in-Java
Rectangle-to-rectangle collision response algorithm.

This project requires you to watch my "Points and Rectangles Collision Detection" tutorial first before doing this project.
Here's the link for that tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZmlEkW5BCo&t=0s

This project is explained in this tutorial

This project demonstrate collision response between two colliding rectangles. Take note, the algorithms used in this project only works with axis-aligned(non-rotated) rectangles.

The 'Complete' directory contains UI codes and collision algorithms. The 'Setup' directory contains UI codes and doesn't contain rectangle-to-rectangle collision response algorithm. Use the files in 'Complete' folder for your reference and use files in 'Setup' folder if you wanna follow my tutorial that I mentioned above.
